          <p className="font-weight-normal">
            While the next outing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has Captain
            America’s name on it, the movie, Civil War has pretty much every
            hero we’ve ever seen in the MCU in it, along with a couple that we
            haven’t. There are a couple of exceptions to this though. One of the
            characters missing in action is The Hulk.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to the screenwriters, a large part of the reason for this
            is that the Hulk really can’t be in the film. It just wouldn’t work,
            because once the Hulk picks a side, the fight is already over. In
            the MCU The Hulk has been every bit the overpowering force as his
            comic book counterpart. He tears through pretty much anything and
            everything that’s ever been thrown at him. If that included half the
            Avengers, is there really anything they could do?{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking with Entertainment Weekly, the screenwriters for Captain
            America: Civil War Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely see the
            Hulk as the game over moment. Markus is of the opinion that if the
            Hulk were to pick a side, everybody else might as well just go home.

#### Why this Stack?

##### React.js

- React is a mature, robust, and industry tested Javascript library with access to loads of npm packages than can work seamlessly inside React. React will allow us to be flexible with what we want to use in our application. Reactâ€™s composition patterns will allow us to fluidly separate individual tasks to individual teammates. 

##### Netlify
- Netlify has a great GUI for deployment versus the other options (Now, Firebase, surge, Heroku, etc.). Netlify also integrates with GitHub, providing an option for continuous deployment. 

##### PostgreSQL/sqlite3
- Lightweight, safe - supports concurrency. 

##### Express/Node.js
- Reliable documentation, good performance, compatible with React, using JS throughout this project 

##### Heroku
- The reasoning behind using Heroku is similar to the reasoning for the use of Netlify. 

##### CSS/Reactstrap/Bootstrap
- We decided to utilize Reactstrap and Bootstrap to take advantage of the ease of responsiveness on those components. In addition to our own custom CSS, along with the ability to customize the frameworks to our liking, it gave us the opportunity to create a design to our liking. 

### Testing

Testing of this application was completed through every stage of development using terminal logging, Chrome DevTools, and Postman. 

Testing was incorporated into this application by each contributor before submitting a pull request to the master branch and after each merge ensure all elements were working together properly. 

In addition, all pull requests were reviewed by one or more team members, and merges were supervised by our project manager. 

The application for the most part was set up to continuously deploy to Netlify and Heroku. In order to satisfy the requirements of continuous deployment, our master branch was automatically checked upon every pull request to mae sure the new code would not break the build. 

### Installation Instructions

##### Frontend Variables:
- REACT_APP_API= please see [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to get an API Key
- REACT_APP_DEV_SERVER_URI= your localhost for server side
- REACT_APP_PROD_SERVER_URI= your deployed server site
- REACT_APP_THE_MOVIE_DB_URL= TMDB Base URL
- REACT_APP_TMDB_URL= TMDB Base URL for images

##### Backend Variables:
- DEBUGGING= boolean
- REDIRECT_URI_PROD= deployed client site
- REDIRECT_URI_DEV= your localhost for client site
- PROD_CLIENT_URI= deployed client site
- DEV_CLIENT_URI= your localhost for client site
- DATABASE_URL= given variable by Heroku when using their PostgreSQL database plugin
- NODE_ENV= tells us to use production or development

* Please see [Twitter Strategy](#twitter-strategy) and [Google Strategy](#google-strategy) for requirements on those variables. 


##### Using the Application

Requirements: 
- Node
- Package Manager (such as Yarn or npm)
    - [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) was used to build this project.

Have Node? Have **Yarn** or **npm**?
Follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone repo

2. Add an `.env` file to both client and server sides at the root of the folder (same level as the `package.json` file). 

3. Add environmental variables for both the frontend and the backend. 

4. Open terminal and `cd` into the server folder and run `yarn install` to install the necessary node_modules on the backend. 

5. `cd` into the client folder and run `yarn install` to install the necessary node_modules on the frontend. 

6. Run `yarn start` on the client folder to run the frontend on `localhost:3000`

7. Run `yarn start` on the server folder to run the backend on `localhost:5000`

8. Your application is now running and can be tested locally.
